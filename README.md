## Abstract

3D content generation from text prompts or single images has made remarkable progress in quality and speed recently. One of its dominant paradigms involves generating consistent multi-view images followed by a sparse-view reconstruction. However, due to the challenge of directly deforming the mesh representation to approach the target topology, most methodologies learn an implicit representation (such as NeRF) during the sparse-view reconstruction and acquire the target mesh by a post-processing extraction. Although the implicit representation can effectively model rich 3D information, its training typically entails a long convergence time. In addition, the post-extraction operation from the implicit field also leads to undesirable visual artifacts. In this paper, we propose FlexiDreamer, a novel single image-to-3d generation framework that reconstructs the target mesh in an end-to-end manner. By leveraging a flexible gradient-based extraction known as FlexiCubes, our method circumvents the defects brought by the post-processing and facilitates a direct acquisition of the target mesh. Furthermore, we incorporate a multi-resolution hash grid encoding scheme that progressively activates the encoding levels into the implicit field in FlexiCubes to help capture geometric details for per-step optimization. Notably, FlexiDreamer recovers a dense 3D structure from a single-view image in approximately 1 minute on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, outperforming previous methodologies by a large margin.
